# Full Stack Trivia API Backend

## Getting Started

Trivia API project is the quiz game,  itâ€™s designed to allow users to test themself in different categories. 

## Tasks

1. Use Flask-CORS to enable cross-domain requests and set response headers. 
2. Create an endpoint to handle GET requests for questions, including pagination (every 10 questions). This endpoint should return a list of questions, a number of total questions, the current category, categories. 
3. Create an endpoint to handle GET requests for all available categories. 
4. Create an endpoint to DELETE question using a question ID. 
5. Create an endpoint to POST a new question, which will require the question and answer a text, category, and difficulty score. 
6. Create a POST endpoint to get questions based on category. 
7. Create a POST endpoint to get questions based on a search term. It should return any questions for whom the search term is a substring of the question. 
8. Create a POST endpoint to get questions to play the quiz. This endpoint should take a category and previous question parameters and return random questions within the given category if provided, and that is not one of the previous questions. 
9. Create error handlers for all expected errors including 400, 404, 422, and 500. 


### Installing Dependencies

#### Pre-requisites and Local Development

Developers using this project should already have Python3, pip and node installed on their local machines.

#### Backend

From the backend folder run Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run the application run the following commands:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run 
```
These commands put the application in development and directs our application to use the 

```bash
__init__.py 
```

[Flask  documentation.](http://flask.pocoo.org/) 
the application is run on  

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

#### Frontend

From the frontend folder, run the following commands to start the client:

```bash
npm install // only once to install dependencies
npm start 
```
By default, the frontend will run on localhost:3000.

### Tests

In order to run tests navigate to the backend folder and run the following commands:

```bash
dropdb bookshelf_test
createdb bookshelf_test
psql bookshelf_test < books.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```

The first time you run the tests, omit the dropdb command.

All tests are kept in that file and should be maintained as updates are made to app functionality.
